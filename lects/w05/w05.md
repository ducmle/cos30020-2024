## Directory separator
- uses the constant `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR`
- constructs long file/directory path name using function `implode`:
  e.g.: `$dir = implode(DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, array($_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"], "dev", "www", "w05", "data"));`

## Directory info
- On Linux, a directory's size is shown as 4096 bytes. This is the size of the directory name data block created for the directory.

## Directory permission
Directory permission may be set by `umask` command: 
Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask

**Note**: 
- umask typically uses an octal value 
- a `1` bit in umask means the corresponding permission is **disabled**
- a `0` bit in umask means the corresponding permission is determined by the file system (i.e. enabled if the file system allows it)

### Enable daemon's write permission to your `dev` directory
These instructions apply if you are setting Xampp on your computer to host the `dev` folder:

1. Make sure that Apache web server process can write to your `dev/w05/data` directory
2. The easiest way to do this is to turn on write permission for `others`, e.g.

```
chmod -R o+w dev/w05/data
```

  - This is not recommended in the production environment, because it means that anyone can write to your data file! 
  - However, it is ok to test your development scripts in this unit.
