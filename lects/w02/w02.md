# Operators
## Operator precedence in PHP
URL: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.precedence.php

- **precedence**: determines binding order of two expressions; e.g. 1 + 5 * 3 = 16 because "*" has a higher precedence than "+"
- equal precedence: **associativity** determines how operators are grouped; e.g. 
  - "-" is left-associative (i.e. grouped left-to-right), so 1 - 2 - 3 is grouped as (1 - 2) - 3 and evaluates to -4. 
  - "=" is right-associative (i.e. grouped right-to-left), so $a = $b = $c is grouped as $a = ($b = $c).
- operators of equal precedence that are non-associative cannot be used next to each other, e.g. 1 < 2 > 1 is illegal
- associativity is only meaningful for binary (and ternary) operators. 
- unary operators are either prefix or postfix, e.g. !!$a is grouped as !(!$a).
- use parentheses in all cases help ease code readability
